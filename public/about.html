  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p><b>"Hey there, folks! I'm Balaganapathy, a newbie in the Electronics and Communication Engineering department. Super pumped to dive into all things circuits, automation, and VLSI design as I kick off this exciting journey.<br>
  <br>
  But hey, don't box me in â€“ I'm also getting my feet wet in Web Development over on Udemy. Yep, I've got this cool website as my first step into the web world.<br>
  <br>
  Lately, I've been realizing what it takes to reach my goals, so I'm going full-on self-taught mode, learning the ABCs of electronics. Just wanted to give you a sneak peek into my dreams and how I'm getting there!"<br>

  Thank you visiting my web page!</b></p>
